## US_Traffic_Accidents
This folder contains documents for capstone1 project of the Data Science Career Track at Springboard.<br>

The objective was to predict the **severity** of the road accident based on various weather conditions, road amenities(e.g. stop signs, speed-bumps, junctions etc.), weekday, hour of the day, side of the road, state and geographic location.<br> 
Severity here refers to the effect of the accident on traffic flow: low severity accidents have little effect while high severity accidents result in higher obstructin of flow.<br>
Upon comparison of four different types of classification models (SGD, KNN, LogisticRegression and Random Forest), the latter two were chosen for further analysis. A final 78% accuracy was achieved using Random Forest. The top four most important features were: longitude, latitude, pressure and windchill.<br> 

The image files are stored in a seperate folder, and the raw dataset can be found in Kaggle under [US Accidents (3.5 million records)!](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).<br>
