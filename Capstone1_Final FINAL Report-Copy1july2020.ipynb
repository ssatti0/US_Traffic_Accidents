    "## Problem Statement: \n",
    "Car accidents in the US average 6million every year, with 3million injuries and over 30,000 fatalities. In fact they are the leading cause of death among healthy Americans. As a result, millions of dollars are spent in medical bills, rapid response teams deployment, and destroyed property. The ability to predict the occurance of accidents given weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and points of interest will have positive repurcussions in fiscal planning, and policies, or even in planning family roadtrip times.\n"

    "## Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In predicting the severity of road accidents, four machine learning classification methods were tried: Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The resulting cross-validation scores differed by up to 28%, mostly depending on the method used, and presence or absence of scaling. The features used in the cross-validation were divided into five subsets. The first subset included only the logitude, latitude, distance, and numerical weather data, while other categorical features were added in each successive subset. The maximum number of features included in a feature_subset was 89. The different feature_subsets did not result in big variations in the score. The exception is SGD.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial 4 classes of severity were consolidated into 2classes: 'low' and 'high'. This gave higher accuracy results while reducing unnecessary computation time. The resulting confusion matrix had less zero filled cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest yielded the best accuracy and f1_scores. It predicted the correct severity (whether 'low' or 'high') 78% of the time. The remaining 22% were incorrectly predicted.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the ultimate purpose for using this model, it might be better to focus more on precision or recall values. However, for the better overall model a high f1_score is better which was the case for this project.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "General findings of the project are:<br>\n",
    "_ The days and times with the least accidents are Sundays followed by Saturdays. The odds of a high severity accident are also low during the weekend, as indicated by the negative coefficient values of the Logistic Regression.<br> \n",
    "_ During the week, 1-3am have the least accidents while morning rush hour has the most.<br>\n",
    "_ Counter-intuitively, 'Clear' and 'Mostly Cloudy' days have the highest number of accidents.<br>\n",
    "_ Even though California, Texas and Florida have the highest **total** number of accidents, the **most severe** occur in Florida, followed by Georgia and California.<br>\n",
    "_ States with the **least** number of severity level 4 accidents are North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont.<br> \n",
    "_ Cities with the highest number of **total** accidents are Houston, Charlotte and Lost Angeles. Those with the **most level 4** accidents are Miami, Atlanta and Houston.<br>\n",
    "_ Of the amenities present in the dataset, most accidents happen at Traffic Signals, Junctions and Crossings.<br>\n",
    "_ Severity level 2 and 4 accidents have steadily increased since 2016, but level 3 seems to be on the decline since 2018 (data is only until December 2019).<br>\n",
    "_ The **total** number of accidents is fluctuating, but overall is showing a steady increase for the period captured in the dataset.<br>\n",
    "_ Logistic regression showed positive coefficients for the Eastern states, and negative coefficients for the Western states. This corresponds to greater odds of high severity accidents in the East than the West.\n",
    "_ Logistic regresson coefficients for Latitude and Longitude were also negative, indicating a low probability ration of high severity accidents with increasing Lat/Long numbers(i.e. towards the West and North).\n",

    "The dataset contains close to 3million accident records from 49 states in the United States. This [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) is compiled by Sobhan Moosavi etal, and is intermittently updated with new data. The version used for this study covers the period *February 2016 to December 2019*, it was collated from several data sources, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.\n",

    "This project has three distinct stages: Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), and Machine Learning.<br>\n",
    "Data Wrangling: involves infilling and tagging the data cells using appropriate methods.<br>\n",
    "EDA: is an exploration of the various attributes in the dataset and their intertwined relationships. It is expected to answer a few questions such as:\n",
    "+ Which states have the highest number of road accidents? <br>\n",
    "+ Is the state with the highest number of accidents also the one with the most severe? <br>\n",
    "+ Which time of day, and day of the week, do those severe accidents happen? <br>\n",

    "  .2. Most accidents occur during the day, on clear weather days, close to Traffic signals, Junctions and Crossings. This is probably because of the higher volume of traffice during the daytime. Drivers tend to drive more carefully when the weather is not clear. As for traffic signals, that's where pedestrians, and traffic tend to converge which probably requires a hightened sense of altertness and attention.\n",
